# SimplifiedExpressions
This is my 2nd project in CSC344.
"Write a set of Clojure functions that perform symbolic simplification and evaluation of boolean expressions using and, or, and not. not will be assumed to take one argument, while and and or will take one or more. You should use false for False and true for True."
